The last communication from the Vittsjö Anomaly (1) was received at 17:28 on 26th August. Garnet team leader reported that initial testing of the Iris Door had begun, and boundary activity had increased by 0.2 Bångström.

Early this morning communication links with the IAT mobile team at Vittsjö were lost. Video from a drone sent by local police shows, negatively, no outdoor beacon as required by communications failure protocol (suggesting the team were unable to send anyone outside the facility) but, positively, no visible change. 

As a precautionary measure, IAT European Regional Command have authorized special agent deployment. You will be reading this while in-flight to Uppsala airbase, and from there you will be dropped by helicopter at Vittsjö. 

Your mission priorities are to investigate if there is a breach, report status of the Iris Door, and communicate to IAT Command. You should also help any surviving members of the mobile team and extract them from danger.

While in-flight the Quartermaster will supply you with a "multi-function device", ammunition, and other supplies. You are licensed to use destructive force at your discretion. 

"Understanding shall be ours!"
