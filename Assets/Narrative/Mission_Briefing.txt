The last communication from Vittsjö Anomaly (1) was received at 17:28 on 26th August. Garnet team leader reported initial testing of the Iris Door had begun, and boundary activity increased by 0.2 Bångström.

Early this morning communication with Vittsjö team was lost. Video from a drone sent by local police shows, negatively, no outdoor beacon as required by communications failure protocol but, positively, no visible change. 

IAT European Regional Command have authorized special agent deployment. You will be reading this while in-flight to Uppsala airbase, and from there you will be taken by helicopter to Vittsjö. 

Your mission priorities are to investigate if any breach, and report status of the Iris Door to IAT Command. Also assist any surviving members of the mobile team and extract them from danger.

While in-flight the Quartermaster will supply you with a "multi-function device" and ammunition. You are licensed to use destructive force. 

"Understanding shall be ours!"
